In this project, I was assigned to help a school district extract the student and course grade files required to become an onboarding partner to our platform. 

The goals of this project were the following: 
  1. Extract student demographic data and ensure alignment to file specifications
  2. Extract course grade data which captures all past course grade data and planned course grade data
  3. The accuracy of these data files are crucial since they inform student accounts on our platform

I explored the databases tables to understand how data was stored within this district's specific Student Information System (SIS). 
I consulted and colloborated with the distirct staff to understand where data was stored. This was a challenging project because I had no prior experience with this 
SIS system but it was extremely rewarding in helping this district get the data necessary to onboard to our college and career readiness platform.
